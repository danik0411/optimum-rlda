NOTE: when using sampling.R, first check the data, sometimes there are NA at the end of each row, probably because of the different \newline symbols between Windows and Linux, but nevermind

data - stores databases with sampling.R files
logs - stores log
runs - stores .R and .sh fiels to run the code
src - contains implementations of estimators
synthetic - stores .R and .sh files to run the code for synthetic data (look into folders, and run the files from proper folders)
temp - all results will be stored there
